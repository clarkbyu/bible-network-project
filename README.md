# Properties and Structure of Bible Lexical Network
### Final Project for BYU MATH 525 - Network Theory 

This data and code, as well as the final report ["Properties and Structure of Bible Lexical Network.pdf"](Properties&#32;and&#32;Structure&#32;of&#32;Bible&#32;Lexical&#32;Network.pdf), were created for the final project of MATH 525. The data was collected by [Christoph Romhild and Chris Harrison](​https://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Visualizations/BibleViz) and was accessed from [UC Irvine](​http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/names.dat) on March 28, 2020. Principles of network theory used came largely from [Networks (2nd Edition)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/networks-9780198805090?cc=us&lang=en&) by [Mark Newman](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/) of the University of Michigan.
